# Overview

This PowerShell script is a comprehensive Office Click-to-Run (C2R) removal tool designed to forcibly uninstall Microsoft Office when standard uninstall methods fail. Here's what the code does:

## Script Overview
The script removes Office 2013, 2016, and O365 Click-to-Run installations through multiple cleanup stages, with performance optimizations using C# inline code for registry and file operations.

## Key Components

### Parameters & Configuration:

- Multiple switches control behavior (Quiet, DetectOnly, Force, etc.)
- Imports a utility module for helper functions
- Requires Administrator privileges unless -NoElevate is specified

### Main Execution Flow:

- **Initialize-Script:** Sets up logging, checks elevation, gathers system info
- **Find-InstalledOfficeProducts:** Detects installed Office products and validates Windows Installer metadata
- **Uninstall-OfficeProducts:** Performs the actual removal through multiple methods
- **Cleanup Functions:** Removes files, registry entries, shortcuts, services, and scheduled tasks

### Removal Methods:

- **ODT-based removal:** Downloads and runs Office Deployment Tool with XML configuration
- **MSI-based removal:** Uses msiexec to remove MSI-installed components
- **Registry cleanup:** Removes Office registry keys and Windows Installer metadata
- **File system cleanup:** Deletes Office installation folders and user data
- **Service cleanup:** Removes Office-related Windows services
- **Shell integration cleanup:** Removes file associations and shortcuts

### Performance Optimizations:

- Batch processing of registry operations
- Optimized file deletion using .NET methods
- Pre-filtering of products before processing
- Parallel preparation of uninstall commands

### Safety Features:

- DetectOnly mode for scanning without removal
- User confirmation unless Force is specified
- Comprehensive logging throughout the process
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

The script is designed as a "nuclear option" for Office removal when standard uninstall methods have failed, ensuring complete cleanup of all Office components from the system.

### Modern PowerShell Features

- **CmdletBinding**: Full parameter validation and help system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error codes
- **Logging**: Structured logging with timestamps and severity levels
- **Modular Design**: Separated utilities into reusable modules

### Enhanced Functionality

- **Better Detection**: Improved Office product detection algorithms
